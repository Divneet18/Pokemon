# Pokemon

In this PA, you will be completing the implementation of a simplified Pokemon game simulator. In the simulator, you will be able to battle a wild Pokemon, catch a wild Pokemon, and interact with the Pokemon storage system, which trainers can use to store their Pokemons. 

Each Pokemon storage system contains a max number of boxes, and each box has a max number of Pokemons it can hold. You can perform a number of operations in the box, such as depositing a Pokemon or releasing one.
